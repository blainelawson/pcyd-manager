PCYD Manager is a database tool for the Pinellas County Young Democrats. It
can essentially be used for other organizations that have board members, members,
and committees.

Most of its functionality is reserved for board members who have the ability to log-in,
take control over committees, create new ones, edit old ones, add new members, and edit
member information.

If you are not logged-in, visitors to this site can view contact information for board
members, committees, as well as who the other members are. General member contact info
is withheld if the visitor is not logged-in.
